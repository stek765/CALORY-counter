# CALORY-COUNTER

My way of tracking kcal of any quantity of food:
1) Register a FOOD or get the TOTAL SUM of your food (from a given file)
2) Put its Name and Quantity
3) Output -> Kcal calculated on your quantity (both for each category ex: Protein, Carbs, Fat.. and the total sum of it)
4) Create or add in a file your foods (in an automatically ordered manner)
